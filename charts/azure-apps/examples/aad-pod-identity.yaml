# This shows how to install aad-pod-identity without bells and whistles
#
# Since the solution is deployed to the `kube-system` namespace you should
# set up the `infra-aas-pod-identity` project in a way that it can only
# manage a subset of resources.
# Specifically you would need to set `namespaceResourceWhitelist` to only
# allow the following resources:
# - group: ''
#   kind: ServiceAccount
# - group: apps
#   kind: DaemonSet
# - group: apps
#   kind: Deployment
# - group: aadpodidentity.k8s.io
#   kind: AzurePodIdentityException
#
# In addition the project needs to allow managing the following cluster
# resources:
# - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#   kind: ClusterRole
# - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
# - group: policy
#   kind: PodSecurityPolicy
#
# The aad-pod-identity Helm chart has a lot of tuneable knobs and the
# above permission will vary depending on your exact configuration.

aadPodIdentity:
  enabled: true
