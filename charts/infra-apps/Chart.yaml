        feat!: Update cert-manager from 1.17.1 to 1.18.1

        The 1.18.0 release contains several new features and changes.
        Highlights include support for ACME certificate profiles,
        a new default for `Certificate.Spec.PrivateKey.RotationPolicy`
        now set to `Always` (breaking change), and the default
        `Certificate.Spec.RevisionHistoryLimit`
        now set to 1 (potentially breaking).

        1.18.1 fixes some timeout issues and uses `PathType: Exact`
        on challenge ingresses.
