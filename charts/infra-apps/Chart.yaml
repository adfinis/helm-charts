        feat: Update argo-cd chart from 8.0.14 to 8.3.1

        Argo CD v3.1 has been released, building upon the foundation of v3.0 with several new features.
        This version introduces beta support for using OCI-compliant registries as a source for Kubernetes
        manifests, alongside improvements to the manifest hydrator to better link code commits. The
        release also stabilizes server-side apply and adds a new UI feature allowing users to scale
        resources like Deployments directly from the interface. Additionally, the update brings support
        for CLI plugins, numerous security and bug fixes, and updates dependencies like Go 1.24.4.
