        feat: Update kyverno from v1.10.0 to v1.11.4

        Potentially breaking:
        * The policy that applies to Deployment/scale subresource has
          been changed to use condition anchor for the condition check.
          This may break your existing policy if you used the policy
          restrict-scale to block the scale action.
        * Policy Reports are now created on a per-resource basis and
          using a UID as the name rather than the previous behavior of
          per-policy. This may be a breaking change if you relied upon
          either of these attributes in previous versions. This change
          has the benefit of putting less pressure on the Kubernetes
          API server and less storage cost on etcd.
        * In accordance with Cosign 2.0 updates, the Rekor URL is now
          required in a policy. The url field may be empty ("") but must
          be specified even if you've opted not to store signatures in a
          Rekor instance. Users upgrading from Kyverno v1.10 to v1.11 who
          have image verification policies using cosign will have to
          explicitly disable Tlogs and SCT verification in their policy
          using the rekor.ignoreTlogs and ctlog.IgnoreSCT fields if they
          did not use Rekor while signing the image.
