        chore: Updated kyverno-policies form 3.4.1 to 3.5.1 inline with the main kyverno Chart.
        Changes:
          - Removed the deprecated top-level field spec.validationFailureAction.
          - Added the new per-rule field spec.validate[*].failureAction as its replacement. Please update your policies to use the new field.
          - Added the spec.validate[*].allowExistingViolations field to policies, which allows existing resources to be exempt from validation rules.
          - Fixed a bug in the merging logic for policyExclude customizations to prevent incorrect overrides.
